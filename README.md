# Functional programming for C# examples

This code is part of the blog post I wrote about functional programming, which
can be found [here](https://tluijken.github.io/posts/functional-programming-in-csharp/).

Any feedback is most welcome, I'll be happy to update this accordingly.

Thank you for your time and interest.
